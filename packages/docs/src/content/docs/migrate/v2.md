title: Migrate to v2
---

v2 is a near ground-up rewrite of svelte-cloudinary, including significant type improvements. This will undoubtedly cause many minor typing issues that would be impractical to cover in this guide. We'll cover the major changes here that you can easily check for and change, and for the type errors, we recommend running [svelte-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-check) on your codebase. We hope that this rewrite will make it much easier for us to maintain this library into the future, especially with Svelte 5 on the horizon. If there is anything we've missed, or you have any issues, then [let us know](https://github.com/cloudinary-community/svelte-cloudinary/issues/new/choose). We'll keep updating this guide as needed to make it as frictionless as possible!

## Configuration

The following environment variables have been renamed:

| Old Name                            | New Name                     | Description                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Your Cloudinary cloud name             |
| `VITE_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`    | `VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`    | API key for use with the upload widget |

## CldImage

### transformations

`transformations` has been deprecated in favour of `namedTransformations` and will be removed in the next version.

## CldOgImage

The `alt` prop is now required.

## CldUploadWidget

### Events

The `onUpload` event has now been deprecated, and will be removed in the next major version. You should migrate to `onSuccess`, which has a similar behaviour.

## CldVideoPlayer

### playerRef

The `playerRef` prop has been renamed to `player`, and is still readonly.

### videoRef

The `videoRef` prop has been renamed to `videoElement`, and is still readonly.

### Version Prop

The `version` prop has been removed and is now controlled and updated internally.

## `getCldImageUrl`

The `GetCldImageUrl`, `GetCldImageUrlOptions`, `GetCldImageUrlConfig`, and `GetCldImageUrlAnalytics` types were removed. You can import `ImageOptions`, `ConfigOptions`, and `AnalyticsOptions` from `@cloudinary-util/url-loader` if you need these.

## `getCldOgImageUrl`

The `GetCldOgImageUrl` type was removed. You can import `ImageOptions`, `ConfigOptions`, and `AnalyticsOptions` from `@cloudinary-util/url-loader` if you need these.

## Dependencies

The [utility libraries](https://github.com/cloudinary-community/cloudinary-util) we use had some breaking changes, as well as new features:

| Library                       | Old Version | New Version |                                                                                                                 |
