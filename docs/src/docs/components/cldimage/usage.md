# Getting Started with CldImage


The CldImage component provides an easy way to deliver images from Cloudinary with the same experience you'd expect inside of a SvelteKit app.

With it comes access to more advanced features like dynamic cropping, background removal, overlays, and other Cloudinary transformations.



## Basic Usage

The basic required props include width, height, src, and alt:

```js
import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';

<CldImage
  width={960}
  height={600}
  src="<Public ID>"
  alt="Description of my image"
  sizes="100vw"
/>
```

*Note: A Cloud Name must be first be configured. See [Installation](/installation) for more details.*

The sizes prop is optional but recommended for responsive sizing.

<CldImage
  width={960}
  height={600}
  src={`images/turtle`}
  sizes="100vw"
/>

The `src` property takes in a Cloudinary Public ID which includes the folder path along with the ID of the image itself.

## Transformations

You can further take advantage of Cloudinary features like background removal and overlays by adding additional props:

```js
<CldImage
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
  src="<Public ID>"
  crop="thumb"
  tint="70:blue:green:purple"
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```

<CldImage
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
  src="images/turtle"
  crop="thumb"
  tint="70:blue:green:purple"
  alt="Description of my image"
/>

## Using Cloudinary URLs

If using a full Cloudinary URL, you might already have transformations applied to your image.

To preserve those transformations, you can apply the `preserveTransformations` property:

```js
<CldImage
  width={600}
  height={600}
  src="<Cloudinary URL>"
  preserveTransformations
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```

*Note: Cloudinary URLs must include a version number (/v1234) in order to be correctly parsed.*
