# Getting Started with CldImage

The CldImage component provides an easy way to deliver images from Cloudinary with the same experience you'd expect inside of a SvelteKit app.

With it comes access to more advanced features like dynamic cropping, background removal, overlays, and other Cloudinary transformations.

As CldImage is a wrapper around the [Unpic Image component](https://unpic.pics/img/svelte/), you also gain access to all built-in Image component features will work out-of-the-box like [Responsive Sizing](/guides/responsive-images).

## Basic Usage

The basic required props include `width`, `height`, `src`, and `alt`:

<HeaderImage>
  <CldImage
    width="960"
    height="600"
    src={`images/turtle`}
    sizes="100vw"
    alt="Turtle in the ocean"
  />
</HeaderImage>

<CodeBlock>

```svelte

<script>
  import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage
  width="960"
  height="600"
  src="<Public ID>"
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```
</CodeBlock>

The `src` property takes in a Cloudinary Public ID which includes the folder path along with the ID of the image itself.
The `width` and the `height` should represent the rendered size and the `alt` value should be a text-based description
of the image.

The `sizes` prop is optional, but recommended for [Responsive Sizing](/guides/responsive-images).


## Transformations

You can further take advantage of Cloudinary features like background removal and overlays by adding additional props:


<HeaderImage>
  <CldImage
    width="500"
    height="500"
    src={`images/turtle`}
    crop="fill"
    removeBackground
    tint="70:blue:green:purple"
    underlay={`images/galaxy`}
    sizes="100vw"
    alt="Turtle in the ocean"
  />
</HeaderImage>

<CodeBlock>

```svelte

<script>
  import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage
  width="500"
  height="500"
  src="<Public ID>"
  crop="fill"
  removeBackground
  tint="70:blue:green:purple"
  underlay="<Public ID>"
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```
</CodeBlock>

## Using Cloudinary URLs

CldImage supports passing a fully qualified Cloudinary URL as the `src`, however, it
must include a version number (/v1234) in order to be correctly parsed.

<Callout emoji={false} type="info">
  The version number is required due to the variable nature of Cloudinary URLs. This helps
  to ensure the integretiy when during the parsing process.
</Callout>

<CodeBlock>

```svelte

<script>
  import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage
  width="500"
  height="500"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/v1234/myimage"
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```
</CodeBlock>

### Preserving URL Transformations

If using a full Cloudinary URL, you might already have transformations applied to your image.

To preserve those transformations, you can apply the `preserveTransformations` property:

```svelte

<script>
  import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage
  width="600"
  height="600"
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/w_100,h_200,c_fill/v1234/myimage"
  preserveTransformations
  alt="Description of my image"
/>
```

## Events

You can capture both the `on:load` and `on:error` events to take actions when your image loads.

In this working example you will see "Turtle has loaded" in the console.

```svelte
<CldImage
  width="960"
  height="600"
  src={`images/turtle`}
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Turtle in the ocean"
	on:load={() => console.log("Turtle has loaded.")}
  on:error={()=>console.error("Turtle Error")}
/>
```

<CldImage
  width="960"
  height="600"
  src={`images/turtle`}
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Turtle in the ocean"
	on:load={() => console.log("Turtle has loaded.")}
  on:error={()=>console.error("Turtle Error")}
/>

In this broken example you will see "Turtle Error" in the console.

```svelte
<CldImage
  width="960"
  height="600"
  src={`images/turtle-broken`}
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Broken Turtle Image"
	on:load={() => console.log("Turtle has loaded.")}
  on:error={()=>console.error("Turtle Error")}
/>
```

<CldImage
  width="960"
  height="600"
  src={`images/turtle-broken`}
  sizes="100vw"
  alt="Broken Turtle Image"
	on:load={() => console.log("Turtle has loaded.")}
  on:error={()=>console.error("Turtle Error")}
/>
