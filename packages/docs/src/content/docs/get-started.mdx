<Steps>
    1.  Install Svelte Cloudinary. We support Svelte v3, v4, v5 (compatibility mode), and SvelteKit!

        <Tabs>
            <TabItem label="npm">
                ```bash
                npm install svelte-cloudinary -D
                ```
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="pnpm">
                ```bash
                pnpm add svelte-cloudinary -D
                ```
            </TabItem>
            <TabItem label="yarn">
                ```bash
                yarn add svelte-cloudinary
                ```
            </TabItem>
        </Tabs>

    2.  Configure svelte-cloudinary

        When using Vite/SvelteKit all you need to do is set the `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` environment variable to your [cloud name](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/finding_your_credentials_tutorial). If you don't have a Cloudinary account you can [create one for free here](https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free?utm_campaign=devx_sveltecloudinary&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=sveltecloudinary)! If you're not using Vite/SvelteKit, or want to learn more about configuration, you can [read the guide here](/config).

        ```bash title=".env"
        # https://cloudinary.com/documentation/finding_your_credentials_tutorial
        VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="<Your Cloud Name>"
        ```

    3.  Start using Cloudinary!

        <CardGrid>
            <LinkCard
                title="Images"
                description="Use Cloudinary to power your images, includes powerful options for resizing, transformations, generative AI, and more."
                href="/components/image" />
            <LinkCard
                title="Open Graph tags"
                description="Svelte Cloudinary makes it easy to create your open graph tags and images with Cloudinary."
                href="/components/og-image" />
            <LinkCard
                title="Upload Widget"
                description="Allow users to easily upload images and then serve them in your app with Cloudinary."
                href="/components/upload-widget" />
            <LinkCard
                title="Video Player"
                description="Play videos uploaded to your Cloudinary account with our built-in video player."
                href="/components/video-player" />
        </CardGrid>

</Steps>
