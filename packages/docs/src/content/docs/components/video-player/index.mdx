import { CldVideoPlayer } from 'svelte-cloudinary';

The `CldVideoPlayer` can be used to embed Cloudinary videos using the [Cloudinary Video Player](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_video_player).

## Basic Usage

The only required props are `width`, `height`, and `src`:

<CldVideoPlayer
	config={{
		cloud: { cloudName: import.meta.env.VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME },
	}}
	width="1920"
	height="1080"
	src="videos/mountain-stars"
	client:load
/>

```svelte
<script>
	import { CldVideoPlayer } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldVideoPlayer width="1920" height="1080" src="videos/mountain-stars" />
```
