The `CldUploadWidget` creates a new instance of the [Cloudinary upload widget](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_widget) giving you an easy way to add upload capabilities to your Svelte app.

The widget will not render any UI by default, instead needing to have the `open` function called. The simplest way to do this is to nest a button inside a slot and use the `open` slot prop. There are two options when using the CldUploadWidget: signed and unsigned. These options allow you to control the amount of security and restrictions you place on uploads.

## Unsigned

Providing that unsigned uploads are allowed for your `uploadPreset` you can simply do:

```svelte
<script>
	import { CldUploadWidget } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldUploadWidget uploadPreset="<your upload preset>" let:open let:isLoading>
	<button on:click={() => open()} disabled={isLoading}>
		Open the widget
	</button>
</CldUploadWidget>
```

## Signed

Signing upload requests require a signature endpoint which uses your Cloudinary secret key to sign the upload request. The following example uses SvelteKit but you can use any server framework to write this:

You'll need to make sure you've configured a Cloudinary API key both on client and server. Read more about configuring [Svelte Cloudinary here](/config).

```svelte
<script>
	import { CldUploadWidget } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
	import {
		PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
		PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
	} from '$env/static/public';
</script>

<CldUploadWidget
	uploadPreset="<your upload preset>"
	signatureEndpoint="/api/sign-cloudinary-params"
	config={{
		cloud: {
			cloudName: PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
			apiKey: PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
		},
	}}
	let:open
	let:isLoading
>
	<button on:click={() => open()} disabled={isLoading}>
		Open the widget
	</button>
</CldUploadWidget>
```

```ts
// src/routes/api/sign-cloudinary-params/+server.ts
import { CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET } from '$env/static/private';
import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary';
import { error, json } from '@sveltejs/kit';

export const POST = async ({ request }) => {
	const body = await request.json();
	const { paramsToSign } = body;

	try {
		const signature = cloudinary.utils.api_sign_request(
			paramsToSign,
			CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
		);

		return json({ signature });
	} catch (e) {
		return error(500, `${error}`);
	}
};
```
