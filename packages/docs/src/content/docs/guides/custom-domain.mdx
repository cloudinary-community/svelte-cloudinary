title: "Adding a Custom Domain"
---

Enhance the delivery of your media assets by integrating svelte-cloudinary with a [private CDN and/or custom domain](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/advanced_url_delivery_options#private_cdns_and_custom_delivery_hostnames_cnames).  

:::note  
**Private CDN** and **Custom Domain** features are available exclusively on [Cloudinary's Advanced plan](https://cloudinary.com/pricing).  
:::  

## Step-by-Step Configuration

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have **svelte-cloudinary** installed in your project:

```bash
npm install svelte-cloudinary
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root (if it doesn't exist already) and add the following variables:

```bash
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name"  
VITE_CLOUDINARY_PRIVATE_CDN="true"  
VITE_CLOUDINARY_SECURE_DISTRIBUTION="your-custom-domain.com"  
```
Replace your_cloud_name with your actual Cloudinary cloud name and your-custom-domain.com with your custom domain. Read more about [configuring svelte-cloudinary here](https://svelte.cloudinary.dev/config).

:::caution
Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore` file to keep sensitive information secure.

## Example Usage

With the configuration in place, use the `<CldImage />` component to serve images through your private CDN and custom domain:

```svelte
<script>
  import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage
  src="<Your Public ID>" 
  alt="Sample Image"
  width="800"
  height="600"
/>
```

This setup ensures that the image URL follows your custom domain structure:

- **Before:** `https://res.cloudinary.com/your_cloud_name/image/upload/sample.jpg`
- **After:** `https://your-custom-domain.com/image/upload/sample.jpg`
