import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';

The `CldImage` component is the main way of displaying a Cloudinary image in your Svelte app.

### Basic Usage

The required props are `width`, `height`, `src`, and `alt`:

<CldImage src="images/turtle" alt="Turtle" width={960} height={600} />

```svelte
<script>
  import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage
  src="images/turtle"
  alt="Turtle"
  width={960}
  height={600}
/>
```

### Transformations

You can use Cloudinary transformations with simple props which are fully typed:

<CldImage
	width={960}
	height={600}
	src="images/turtle"
	alt="Blue Turtle"
	tint="70:blue:purple"
/>

```svelte
<script>
  import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage
  width={960}
  height={600}
  src="images/turtle"
  alt="Blue Turtle"
  tint="70:blue:purple"
/>
```

### Using Cloudinary URLs

We support passing a Cloudinary URL as the `src` as long as it contains a version number (`/v1234`).

```svelte
<script>
  import { CldImage } from 'svelte-cloudinary';
</script>

<CldImage
  width={960}
  height={600}
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/svelte-cloudinary/image/upload/v1/images/turtle"
  alt="Turtle"
/>
```

#### Preserve Transformations

If you're using the full Cloudinary URL as your `src` it might contain transformations. To preserve these transformations you can set the `preserveTransformations` prop.
